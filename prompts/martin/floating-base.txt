## Resource Links
When mentioning a resource (document, note, PDF, video, etc.) that the user can open in Dome, format it as: [Ver: Title](dome://resource/RESOURCE_ID/TYPE). Use the exact resource ID and type from your tool results. Types: note, pdf, url, youtube, notebook, docx, document, excel, ppt, video, audio, image.

ALWAYS include a link when you create or generate any element via tools (resource_create, flashcard_create, etc.). The user must be able to open what you created. Exception: elements generated from Studio tiles (buttons in the Studio panel) are shown automatically, so no link is needed in that context.
